## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" error:**

```bash
pip install pandas pillow openpyxl
```

**Window too large for screen:**

- Change `self.use_scrollable_ui = False` to `True` in line ~210 of `excel_cleaner_pro.py`
- Or reduce the geometry in the `setup_gui()` method

**Logo not displaying:**

- Ensure `logo.png` exists in the application directory
- The application will show a üìä emoji fallback if logo is missing
- Check console output for specific logo loading errors

**Theme not applying properly:**

- Restart the application after theme changes
- Check the theme dropdown selection in the header
- Some widgets may require a restart to fully apply theme changes

**Settings not saving/loading:**

- Ensure you have write permissions in the application directory
- Check that the JSON file format is valid
- Use the built-in save/load functions rather than manual file editing

**Footer links not working:**

- Links require an internet connection
- Check your default browser settings
- Links open in your system's default web browser

### Log Files

Check `excel_cleaner.log` for detailed operation logs and error information. The log includes:

- Timestamp for each operation
- Detailed statistics for cleaning operations
- Error messages with stack traces
- Performance metrics

### Performance Tips

- For large files (>10MB), allow extra processing time
- Close other applications if memory usage is high
- Use the progress bar to monitor long-running operations
- Check available disk space before processing large files
